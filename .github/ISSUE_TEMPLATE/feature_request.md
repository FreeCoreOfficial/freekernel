name: Feature request
about: Propose a new kernel feature, subsystem, or architectural improvement
title: "[FEATURE] "
labels: enhancement
assignees: ''

## Problem / Motivation

Describe the problem or limitation you are trying to solve.

Examples:
- missing abstraction (VFS, scheduler class, device model)
- current implementation is too limited or fragile
- feature needed for next development level

Explain **why** this feature matters.

---

## Proposed solution

Describe the solution you would like to see implemented.

Be as concrete as possible:
- new subsystem or driver
- changes to existing architecture
- new API or abstraction layer

Mention affected areas if known (e.g. `vmm`, `scheduler`, `fs`, `drivers`).

---

## Technical details (if any)

If you have technical ideas, describe them here:
- algorithms
- data structures
- references (OSDev Wiki, papers, specs)

This section is optional but highly appreciated.

---

## Alternatives considered

Describe any alternative approaches you have considered.

Examples:
- simpler but less robust solution
- different scheduling or memory model
- postponing the feature to a later level

Explain trade-offs if possible.

---

## Impact & risks

What could this feature affect?

- performance impact
- stability risks
- interaction with interrupts / memory / user mode
- compatibility with current design

---

## Scope & priority

- Is this feature required for the next development level?
- Is it experimental or core?
- Should it be optional or mandatory?

---

## Additional context

Add any other context that may help:
- screenshots (if applicable)
- diagrams
- links to specs or discussions

🧠 **Note**

Chrysalis OS favors correctness and clarity over shortcuts.
Well-thought-out feature requests are more likely to be accepted.
